ush
---

An additional layer between terminal and shell/applications.
It's supposed to be to shell what is vim to ed. Allowing any
automatization layer independent from application (if it's
working in terminal).

Another feature (available now) is possibility to multiplex
input. For example I run R repl through ush, creating named
pipe which is side input. So I can use R normally (possibly
with some keybindings or scripts (yet to be implemented),
but allowing input from other programs at the same time.
